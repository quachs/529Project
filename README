Goal: Index a corpus provided by user, then 
present the user with a GUI that allows them to query corpus

----------------------------------------------------------------

General Program Flow:
1. User selects a directory containing a corpus
2. Program indexes all terms in a corpus, building a dictionary that maps
	terms to positional posting lists
3. Program displays GUI to user

4a. User enters query in text box
5a. Program displays a list of documents that match query
6a. User double-clicks on one of the document titles
7a. Program displays document in its entirety
8a. Return to step 3 or click [X] in top-right corner of window to terminate program

4b. User enters token in text box and clicks "Stem" button
5b. Program displays stemmed term in a dialog box
6b. User clicks "OK" button
7b. Return to step 3

4c. User clicks "Index new directory" button
5c. Return to step 1

4d. User clicks "Print Vocabulary" button
5d. Program displays all terms stored in index in alphabetical order

----------------------------------------------------------------

Types of user queries that will work:
AND queries -> [query literal | wildcard query | near query | phrase query]+
OR queries -> [AND query]+
AUTHOR queries -> [query literal]
	NOTE: "author query" option must be selected from drop down menu

Literals/Queries:
query literal - a standard, one-word term
wildcard query - a one-word term with leading, trailing, or embedded * characters
near query - a literal of the form [term1] near\[k] [term2]
phrase query - a sequence of terms enclosed in double quotes

Types of user queries that will not work:

... [wildcard literal] near\[k] [query literal] ...
... [query literal] near\[k] [wildcard literal] ...
... [wildcard literal] near\[k] [wildcard literal] ...

In other words, wildcard queries can not be embedded within near queries
